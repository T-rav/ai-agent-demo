# AI Glossary: Essential Terms for Understanding Artificial Intelligence

This comprehensive glossary covers key terms and concepts essential for understanding artificial intelligence, machine learning, and related technologies in 2025.

## Core AI Concepts

**Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure or set of rules for solving a problem or completing a task. In AI, algorithms process data to make predictions, classifications, or decisions.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and problem-solve like humans.

**Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

**Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.

**Neural Network**: A computing system inspired by biological neural networks, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information.

## Data and Training

**Training Data**: The dataset used to teach a machine learning model, containing input examples and their corresponding correct outputs.

**Validation Data**: A separate dataset used to evaluate model performance during training and tune hyperparameters.

**Test Data**: A final dataset used to assess the performance of a completed model, simulating real-world usage.

**Overfitting**: When a model learns the training data too specifically, performing well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.

**Underfitting**: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data.

**Feature**: An individual measurable property or characteristic of observed phenomena. Features are the input variables used to make predictions.

**Label**: The correct answer or target output for supervised learning problems, used to train the model.

## Model Types and Architectures

**Supervised Learning**: Machine learning approach using labeled training data to learn the mapping between inputs and desired outputs.

**Unsupervised Learning**: Learning patterns from data without labeled examples, often used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, or anomaly detection.

**Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken.

**Transformer**: A neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms, particularly effective for natural language processing tasks.

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A deep learning architecture particularly effective for processing grid-like data such as images.

**Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: A neural network designed to work with sequential data by maintaining internal memory.

## Natural Language Processing

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The branch of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

**Large Language Model (LLM)**: A neural network trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

**Tokenization**: The process of breaking down text into smaller units (tokens) such as words, subwords, or characters for processing.

**Embedding**: A vector representation of data (such as words or sentences) that captures semantic meaning in a numerical format.

**Attention Mechanism**: A technique that allows models to focus on different parts of the input when making predictions, particularly important in transformers.

**Fine-tuning**: The process of taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a specific task with additional training on task-specific data.

## AI Safety and Ethics

**Bias**: Systematic errors or unfairness in AI systems that can lead to discriminatory outcomes for certain groups or individuals.

**Fairness**: The principle that AI systems should treat all individuals and groups equitably, without discrimination.

**Explainability**: The ability to understand and interpret how an AI system makes decisions, crucial for trust and accountability.

**Hallucination**: When an AI system generates information that appears plausible but is actually false or fabricated.

**Alignment**: Ensuring that AI systems behave in accordance with human values and intentions.

**Robustness**: The ability of an AI system to maintain performance when faced with unexpected inputs or adversarial attacks.

## Generative AI

**Generative AI**: AI systems capable of creating new content, including text, images, audio, or video, based on training data patterns.

**Prompt**: The input text or instruction given to a generative AI model to guide its output.

**Prompt Engineering**: The practice of crafting effective prompts to get desired outputs from AI models.

**Few-shot Learning**: The ability of a model to learn new tasks with only a few examples.

**Zero-shot Learning**: The ability to perform tasks without any specific training examples for that task.

**Chain-of-Thought**: A prompting technique that encourages models to break down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses.

**Vector Database**: A specialized database designed to store and search high-dimensional vectors, commonly used in RAG systems.

**Semantic Search**: Search based on the meaning and context of queries rather than exact keyword matching.

**Chunking**: The process of breaking documents into smaller, manageable pieces for processing and retrieval.

**Grounding**: Connecting AI model outputs to specific sources or evidence to improve accuracy and enable verification.

## Technical Terms

**Hyperparameter**: Configuration settings for machine learning algorithms that are set before training begins, such as learning rate or network architecture.

**Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm used to minimize the error of machine learning models by iteratively adjusting parameters.

**Backpropagation**: The algorithm used to train neural networks by calculating gradients and updating weights to minimize prediction errors.

**Inference**: The process of using a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

**Latency**: The time delay between input and output in an AI system, crucial for real-time applications.

**Throughput**: The number of requests or operations an AI system can handle per unit of time.

## Evaluation Metrics

**Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions made by a model out of all predictions.

**Precision**: The percentage of positive predictions that were actually correct.

**Recall**: The percentage of actual positive cases that were correctly identified by the model.

**F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.

**Perplexity**: A metric used to evaluate language models, measuring how well the model predicts a sample of text.

**BLEU Score**: A metric for evaluating the quality of machine-translated text by comparing it to reference translations.

## Deployment and Operations

**MLOps**: The practice of applying DevOps principles to machine learning, including model versioning, monitoring, and deployment.

**Model Drift**: The degradation of model performance over time as real-world data changes from the original training data.

**A/B Testing**: Comparing two versions of a model or system to determine which performs better in real-world conditions.

**Edge Computing**: Running AI models on local devices rather than in the cloud, reducing latency and improving privacy.

**Federated Learning**: Training machine learning models across distributed devices while keeping data localized.

## Emerging Technologies

**Multimodal AI**: Systems that can process and understand multiple types of input (text, images, audio) simultaneously.

**Foundation Models**: Large, general-purpose models trained on diverse data that can be adapted to many specific tasks.

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**: Hypothetical AI that matches or exceeds human cognitive abilities across all domains.

**Neuromorphic Computing**: Computer architectures designed to mimic the structure and function of biological neural networks.

**Quantum Machine Learning**: The intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, potentially offering computational advantages for certain problems.
